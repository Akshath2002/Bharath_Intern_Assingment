This code uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify the Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal lengths. 
It loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, makes predictions, 
and then calculates accuracy and prints a classification report.

Remember that Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm and might be more suitable for this type of problem compared to linear regression.
If you're interested in a multiclass classification problem like the Iris dataset, 
Logistic Regression can work well. However, for more complex datasets and problems, 
you might need to explore other classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.
